# Numpy Basic Operations

This repository is intended for beginners who would like to make an introduction to numpy.<br/>
It is a collection of some of the basic numpy operations (along with a few Python operations).

You can run the cells, play around the code and see what happens.<br/>
If you then try to learn more about any operations, you can always look it up online.<br/>
The goal of this repository is just to show you a fraction of what can be done via numpy.

I compiled these operations mostly when I was going through two notebooks/repositories:<br/>
Kaggle: Orhan Sertkaya - NumPy Tutorial for Beginners<br/>
Github: Nicolas P. Rougier - 100 numpy exercises

If anybody finds this repository helpful, then it is thanks to Orhan Sertkaya and Nicolas P. Rougier.<br/>
If there is a mistake within the repository, then it is my fault; please let me know and I will try to fix it.
